# LSA Music Learning App

A web-based application that guides users through Learning Sequence Activities (LSAs) from music learning theory, providing a structured approach to developing musical skills through audiation.

## Overview

This app simplifies the complex process of Learning Sequence Activities by providing a clear, stepwise progression for both tonal and rhythm patterns. Unlike traditional ear training applications, this app is built on Gordon's Music Learning Theory principles, focusing on developing audiation skills through sequential learning activities.

## Features

- **Stepwise LSA Progression**: Follow a carefully sequenced learning path for either tonal or rhythm patterns
- **Audio-Based Learning**: Clear audio examples for each step in the learning sequence
- **Supplementary Resources**: Links to relevant YouTube videos and additional learning materials
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Accessible on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Simple Interface**: Easy navigation through LSA steps without login requirements

## Target Users

- Music students (age 10+) working on developing audiation skills
- Music teachers looking for resources to supplement LSA-based instruction
- Self-directed learners interested in Gordon's Music Learning Theory approach

## How It Works

1. Choose between Tonal LSA or Rhythm LSA progression
2. Start at Step 1 and progress through the sequence at your own pace
3. Listen to audio examples and practice audiating the patterns
4. Move to the next step when ready

## Unique Approach

Unlike conventional ear training apps that focus primarily on interval recognition or sight-reading, this app follows the sequential learning approach developed by Edwin Gordon. This methodology emphasizes:

- Learning to think musically before reading notation
- Building a vocabulary of tonal and rhythm patterns
- Developing audiation (the ability to hear and comprehend music mentally)
- Following a research-based learning sequence that mirrors language acquisition

## Future Development

While currently focused on delivering audio examples in a sequential format, future versions may incorporate:

- Pitch recognition technology for interactive practice
- Progress tracking and assessment tools
- Visual notation supplements
- Customizable LSA sequences for teachers

## About Music Learning Theory

Music Learning Theory is an explanation of how we learn when we learn music, developed by Dr. Edwin E. Gordon after extensive research. LSAs (Learning Sequence Activities) are a structured approach to teaching musical skills based on this theory.
